        Confidentiality and Security of Data
      </Box>
      <Box>
        We consider the confidentiality and security of your information to be
        of the utmost importance. We will use industry standard physical,

        or unless such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a
        physical threat to you or others, as permitted by applicable law.
        Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment we cannot
        guarantee the security of Personally Identifiable Information, and there
        is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to
        circumvent our security systems or that transmission of your information
        over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your responsibility to
        protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mails
